    The ICC World Test Championship (WTC), is the biennial Cricket tournament organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). In line with the ICC's goal of having one pinnacle tournament for each of the three formats of international cricket, it is the premier championship for Test cricket.[1] Australia are the current champions, having defeated India in the 2023 final. India have played in each WTC final, finishing runners-up in both.
